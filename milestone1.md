### Question of Interest
The focus of this experiment is to investigate the relationship between commute time and late arrival time. In particular, a survey will be conducted on the 2018-2019 cohort of Masters of Data Science (MDS) students at the University of British Columbia (UBC).  The goal of this experiment is to address the specific question:  **Does the commute time to UBC of a MDS student influence their late arrival time to the first class?**

To uncover the question of interest the following questions will be included in our survey:
- What is your average commute time to the University of British Columbia? - (numerical input)
- During Blocks 1 through 6, what percentage of classes have you arrived late? - (numerical input)
- If you answered a number greater than 0%, for the days you were late, what was the average time (in minutes) that you were late? - (numerical input)

To handle potential confounding variables the survey will include these additional questions:
- What method of transportation do you use? - (transit, bike, walk, drive)
- Do you live on or off campus? - (On Campus, Off Campus)
- Do you consider your self a Morning Person or Night Owl? - (Morning Person, Night Owl)
- How much sleep (in minutes) do you get on an average night? - (numerical input)
- Do you work part time? (Yes, No)
- Are you involved in any clubs or extracurriculars? (Yes, No)
- Do you have breakfast/coffee at home, buy on campus, or neither? (At Home, On Campus, Neither)
- How well do you perceive your performance in this program - (Below Average, Average, Above Average, Prefer not to Say)
- Do you live with a partner/family/dog - (Yes, No)

## Analysis

We are planning to use a two-tailed hypotheses test to quantify whether length of commute will influence when MDS students arrive for their first class.
The null hypothesis will be “the length of commute does not influence when MDS students arrive for their first class”. The alternative hypothesis will be “yes, the length of commute does influence when MDS students arrive for their first class”.

The study is observational in nature and will only address the association between commute time and arrival time. Moreover, the data considered is focused on MDS students and is not generalizable to a larger population.
