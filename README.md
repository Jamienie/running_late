## Overview

The focus of this experiment is to investigate the relationship between commute time and late arrival time. In particular, a survey will be conducted on the 2018-2019 cohort of Masters of Data Science (MDS) students at the University of British Columbia (UBC). The goal of this experiment is to address the specific question: **Does the commute time to UBC of a MDS student influence their late arrival time to the first class?** The full proposal of the experiment, including background, survey questions, analysis type, and ethical considerations can be found in [milestone1.md](milestone1.md).
