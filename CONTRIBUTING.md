# Contributing

### How to Contribute
1. Fork the master repository
2. Clone the forked repository to your computer locally `git clone <forked_repo_URL>`
3. Link the master and forked repository `git remote add upstream <original_repo_URL>`
4. Send pull requests from your forked repository to the master repository
5. A team mate who did not send the pull request will merge the request
    - If a teammate feels the pull request should not be merged, schedule a team meeting with the team to discuss

### Communication
To ensure open and transparent communication create an issue in the master repository. When there are task oriented issues, before working on the task add a comment assigning the task to yourself.
If you see a bug or typo either create an issue so the teammate responsible for the file is aware or fix the issue yourself and send a pull request.

### Commit Messages
When adding new files or making changes to existing files write simple and descriptive commit messages. For readability have:
- one commit message per task
- the title of the file (add the purpose if the title is not a good description)
- the changes in the file is being updated
